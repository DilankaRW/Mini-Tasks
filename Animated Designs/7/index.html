            Assessing the renewable energy potential using a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach provides a spatially explicit understanding of where and how much renewable energy can be harnessed. This methodology integrates various data sources, including topography, meteorological data, land use patterns and infrastructure to provide a comprehensive picture of the renewable energy landscape.
            This research aims to delve into the renewable energy potential of Sri Lanka using a GIS-based approach, focusing on solar, wind, hydro and biomass energy sources. Through this investigation, we hope to provide a blueprint for policymakers, investors and researchers, guiding the nation towards a sustainable energy future.<br><br>
